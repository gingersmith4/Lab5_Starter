Answers:
1) Unit tests are not the best choice for testing the entire message application. there are multiple components interacting with eachother that
aren't just isolated methods or code to test in a messaging application (like the user interface). 
2)  Yes, unit testing is a good choice for testing the "max message length" feature in a messaging application. This feature is specific and isolated,
   we can easily test the text input handler or message validation function for having a maximum length.
